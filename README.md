# Inclusive-Education-FrontendWebsite

This Web Page was made using HTML, CSS, Javascript. I learned to use CSS media Queries, Flex-box and HTML forms. I also learned to create responsive web page using HTML, CSS and DOM using Javascript during this project. 

To see the website clone the project to your local machine and open the "index.html" file and open it on any browser. All other files are connected to that page since the "index.html" page is the home page of the website. This is the frontend of this website and it is fully working, you can open the code on any text editor such as "Brackets" or "Visual Studio Code".
